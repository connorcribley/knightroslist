# Knightro's List

## Description

Knightro's List is a Yelp-inspired website created using a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) software solution stack which allows users to review various locations around the campus of the University of Central Florida. It allows users to register and log into an account, create, read, update, and delete locations, and create and delete reviews of each respective location. This project showcases the features of CRUD operations, authentication, and authorization that are foundational to object-oriented software development.
